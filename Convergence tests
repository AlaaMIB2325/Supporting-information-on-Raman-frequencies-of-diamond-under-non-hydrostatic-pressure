Convergence tests

kpoint convergence
#we varied the kpoint [2,4,6,8,10] in the file kp.sh
#run ./kp.sh
#output kp.dat file
#polt the Energy vs kp using gnuplot

ecut convergence
#we varied the ecut in range [70..200..10] in the file ecut.sh
#run ./ecut.sh
#output ecut.dat file
#polt the Energy vs ecut using gnuplot

alat convergence
#we varied the alat values in the file alat.sh
#run ./alat.sh
#output ecut.dat file
#plot the Energy vs alat using gnuplot


After that we also preformed ev.x calculations for both fcc, bct 
They coincide, plot the results.

we found for fcc equation of state: murnaghan.
# a0 =  6.6639 a.u.
# a0 =  3.52639 Ang 
and for bct 
equation of state: keane.
# V0 =    4.71 a.u.^3
# V0 =    0.70  Ang^3

visualize the input files with the obtained values from the convergence tests for both fcc and bct using Xcrysden

Similarly done for rhombohedral unit cell, in case of [111].
