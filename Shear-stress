#In the case of the loading along the [001] axes.

#used Akaham's equation P=3141-4.157\omega+1.429e-3\omega**2, assuming that P=sigma_z
taking P in the range [200,400]
and \omega in the range [1700,1900]
#wrote a python code to find P(\omega), then used our expression to calculat \sigma_r 
#finding the root of the expression 
#haveing sigma_z and sigma_r we calculated the sheare stress \tau=sigma_z-\sigma_r
#plot \tau vs \sigma_z ()




#In the case of the loading along the [111] axes.
#minimized the proposed expression to find \sigma_r and \sigma_z
#calculated the shear stress
#plot \tau vs \sigma_z
