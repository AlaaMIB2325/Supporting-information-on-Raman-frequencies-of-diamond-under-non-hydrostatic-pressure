Splitting and constant volume calculations for bct and rhombohedral

#in the input file of bct.scf we varied the c/a and a keeping the volume constant (V/a^3=c/a)
#run .scf obtained output file where the stress tensor is no longer diagonal, extract the values of sr and sz 
#plot sr vs sz (constant volume plot)

#Then preform ph.x calculations for each of the .scf .nscf files, get the ws and wd
#plot ws/wd vs sz (splitting)
