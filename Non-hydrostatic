Splitting and constant volume calculations for bct and rhombohedral

#in the input file of bct.scf we varied the c/a and a keeping the volume constant (V/a^3=c/a)
#run .scf obtained output file where the stress tensor is no longer diagonal, extract the values of \sigma_r and \sigma_z 
#plot \sigma_r vs \sigma_z (constant volume plot)

#Then preform ph.x calculations for each file, get the \omega_s and \omega_d
#plot \omeg_s and \omeg_d vs \sigma_z (splitting)

#in the input file of rhombohedral.scf we varied the c/a and a keeping the volume constant (V/a^3=c/a)
#run .scf obtained output file where the stress tensor is no longer diagonal, extract the values of \sigma_r and \sigma_z 
#plot \sigma_r vs \sigma_z (constant volume plot)

#Similarly, for the rhombohedral
