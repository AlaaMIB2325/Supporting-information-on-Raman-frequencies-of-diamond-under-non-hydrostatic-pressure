We did calculations of the hydrostatic case for fcc, bct and rhombohedral.
#varying the lattice paremeter in the input file
#then take the values of the stress tensor from the output file
#where the stress tensor is diagonal and \sigma_x=\sigma_y=\sigma_r=\sigma_z
#we did phonon calculations and obtained the wavenumber(cm^-1)
#plot the results.
